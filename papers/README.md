Statistical  machine  translation  (SMT) is applied in several of the papers. Check if applicable for a small corpus.

Mainly, there are three approaches to diacritics restoration(text 2):
1. Rule-based approach
2. Statistical approach
3. Hybrid approach.

Ways to solve:
1. Word-level
2. Morphemes-level
3. Letter-level
